# AstroAI: AI-Powered Exoplanet Detection Simulator

![AstroAI Logo](assets/logo.png)

## Overview
AstroAI is an interactive tool that simulates exoplanet detection using synthetic telescope data and AI. Built for the IEEE Quarterly Projects Fall 2025 challenge (theme: "space"), it generates light curves from planetary transits, adds noise, and uses a neural network to detect candidates. It's educational, with tutorials on astrophysics concepts.

This project was inspired by NASA missions like Kepler and TESS, aiming to make space data analysis accessible.

## Features
- **Data Simulation**: Generate custom light curves with parameters like orbital period, planet radius, and noise.
- **AI Detection**: PyTorch-based neural network classifies transits with probability scores.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Streamlit web app for real-time simulations and visualizations.
- **Educational Mode**: Explains concepts like Kepler's laws and signal processing.

## Installation
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/astroai.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the app: `streamlit run app.py`

## Usage
- Launch the app and adjust sliders for planet parameters.
- Click "Simulate" to generate a light curve.
- Click "Detect" to run AI analysis and view results.

## Project Story
### Inspiration
Our inspiration stemmed from exoplanet discoveries via telescopes like NASA's Kepler and TESS. We wanted to blend AI with astrophysics for an educational tool.

### What it does
Generates synthetic data, detects transits with AI, and provides visualizations.

### How we built it
Used Python for core logic, PyTorch for the model, and Streamlit for the interface. Trained on synthetic datasets.

### Challenges
Modeling realistic noise and optimizing training on limited hardware.

### Accomplishments
Achieved >90% detection accuracy; open-sourced for community use.

### What we learned
Deepened knowledge in orbital mechanics, time-series AI, and agile development.

### What's next
Integrate real NASA data, advanced models, and hardware support.
